# TASK - 1

API END_POINT: http://localhost:3000/api/singer/get_singers_by_name

I have added singerController to handle singer-releated api calls. The singers data which is given in the task is stored as an arry in the data folder in the root directory. Likewise, the API call which we make to itunes will be done by the singer file in axios folder. Combining of nestd arrays and sorting will perfomed by helper functins in the utils folder. The routes folder take care of all the routes and the services folder looks after the database operations.
